# CS-370-Current-and-Emerging-Trends-in-CS
CS-370 Portfolio Project
## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was provided with the TreasureMaze.py class, which defined the environment and game rules, and the GameExperience.py class, which handled the experience replay memory. I was also given the skeleton of the Jupyter Notebook, including helper functions for building the neural network (build_model) and visualizing the game (show). I was responsible for creating the Deep Q-Learning algorithm within the qtrain function. This involved writing the code to initialize the training loop, implement the epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation, execute the agent's actions, store the resulting episodes in the replay memory, and trigger the neural network training step.
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists apply computational thinking to model complex problems and design algorithms that solve them efficiently. They build the software and intelligent systems that automate tasks, analyze vast amounts of data, and optimize processes that would be impossible for humans to handle manually. This work matters because it drives innovation across every sector of society, from creating autonomous navigation systems (like the pirate agent) to advancing medical research and securing global communications.
## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by decomposing complex challenges into smaller, manageable components, such as breaking down the maze game into discrete states, actions, and rewards. I utilize abstraction to represent real-world scenarios as data (converting the maze grid into a numerical array) and apply algorithmic thinking to design logical steps for a solution. Crucially, this approach involves iterative development—testing, analyzing data like win rates, and debugging code to refine the solution until it consistently meets the desired criteria.
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
To the end user, my responsibility is to ensure the software is reliable, safe, and performs its intended function correctly without bias or unpredictable errors. To the organization, I must ensure that my code is efficient, maintainable, and secure, avoiding the waste of computational resources. Furthermore, I have a duty to be transparent about the capabilities and limitations of the AI models I build, ensuring they are not misrepresented or used in ways that could deceive stakeholders or violate data privacy.
